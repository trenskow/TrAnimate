/*!
 The `TrAnimation` protocol defines a set of methods and properties that are common to all types of animations. As an example the `TrAnimationGroup` only adds animations of objects that conform to this protocol.
 
 ## Implementations
 
 The build-in animations and groups below conform to this protocol.
 
 - TrAnimationGroup
   - TrConstruct
 - TrLayerAnimation
   - TrOpacityAnimation
     - TrFadeAnimation
   - TrPositionAnimation
     - TrPushAnimation
   - TrScaleAnimation
     - TrPopInAnimation
   - TrRotateAnimation
 - TrDirectAnimation

 Tells the receiver to cancel the animation. The animating content will stay at it's current position in animation - and the completion handler will be invoked.
